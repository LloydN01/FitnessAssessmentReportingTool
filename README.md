# Fitness Assessment Reporting Tool

This project aims to develop a web-based platform for a UWA Sport and Exercise Science core unit. The platform will enable students to collect and report fitness assessment data, addressing the issue of outdated or non-representative normative values. By collating fitness data from students, the platform will establish "Sport Science Students Norms" providing accurate benchmarks for comparison. The platform should allow students to enter fitness assessment data, store and aggregate data, generate class norms, and provide detailed reports and visualisations for tracking progress and identifying improvement areas. It should also allow staff to access and manage data, and generate reports for students.

## Features

-   **Data Entry:** Students can log in and enter fitness assessment results.
-   **Data Storage:** Secure storage and aggregation of data to generate class norms.
-   **Reporting:** Detailed reports comparing individual fitness variables against class data.
-   **Visualisations:** Insightful analytics and visualisations to track progress and identify improvement areas.
